# Audio & Signal Processing 
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks developed in Python to demonstrate core competencies in scientific programming, signal processing, and data visualization. These projects are intended to support applications that require knowledge in Python, mathematics, natural or engineering sciences, and experience with NumPy, Matplotlib, and signal/data processing.

## 1: Audio_signal_verarbeitung.ipynb
**Goal:**
Analyze and visualize an audio signal in the time and frequency domains using Python. This notebook demonstrates the basics of audio signal processing, including reading .wav files, plotting waveforms, and performing a Fourier Transform.

**Features:**
+ Load and inspect .wav audio files
+ Visualize waveform in the time domain
+ Apply Fourier Transform (FFT)
+ Visualize the frequency spectrum

**Requirements:**
+ Python 3.x
+ numpy
+ matplotlib
+ scipy

**Notes:**
Make sure the audio file sample_audio.wav (or another .wav) is located in the same directory as the notebook.

Use stereo or mono .wav files with a standard sample rate (e.g., 44100 Hz).


## 2: signal_analysis.ipynb
**Goal:**
Plot mathematical functions and their derivatives to demonstrate analytical skills in a numerical environment. This notebook is focused on using NumPy and Matplotlib for symbolic-like computation and function visualization.

**Features:**
+ Define mathematical functions (e.g. sine, cosine, exponential)
+ Compute derivatives analytically or numerically
+ Plot both functions and their derivatives
+ Use subplots and legends for clarity
