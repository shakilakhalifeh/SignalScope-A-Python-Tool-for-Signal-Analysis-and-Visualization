# SignalScope: A Python Tool for Signal Analysis and Visualization
Build a Python script that loads a signal(e.g. from a CSV or simulated sin wave + noise ). After that applying common signal processing techniques (e.g., filtering, FFT), and visualizing the results interactively by using Matplotlib.

#Features: 
+ Generate or load sample signals(noisy sine wave, square wave, etc)
+ Perform:
  + Fourier Transform(FFT)
  + Smoothing(e.g., moving average or Gaussian filter)
  + Filtering(low-pass / high-pass)
+ Visualize:
  + Time domain
  + Frequency domain
+ Interactive elements(e.g., using matplotlib.widgets in Jupyter)
